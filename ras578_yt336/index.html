				<p>ukule-LED is a ukulele with LEDs embedded in its fretboard. These LEDs can light up in configurations corresponding to different chords, which can aid the ukulele player in learning how to play certain chords, or can act as a chord reference for a more advanced player. ukule-LED has two modes of operations. First, in "play" mode, the user can feed the system a song file, a text file that contains the tempo, time signature, and an ordered listing of the chords in a song. The ukulele will light up the correct chords at the correct times in the song. In "practice" mode, the user can specify a single chord, which is lit up indefinitely.</p>

        <p>ukule-LED is made up of two major components. First is the ukulele itself. We use sixteen RGB LEDs, embedded in the fretboard before the first four frets on each string. These LEDs are wired to the microcontroller, which is mounted on the ukulele itself. The ukulele is wired to a PC, which runs a companion program with a command line interface. From this interface, the user can put the device in "play" mode and specify a path to a song file, or put the device in "practice" mode and specify a chord name.</p>

          <p class="caption">Figure 1: High Level Project Structure</p>
        </div>
				
				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Inspiration and Rationale</strong></p>

				<p>Our inspiration for this project comes from a variety of sources. Our idea to upgrade a musical instrument using LEDs comes from various Hackaday articles, including <a href="http://hackaday.com/2014/08/26/gemma-powered-neopixel-sound-reactive-drums/">this</a> one. We considered using LEDs to augment a couple of other instruments, including a keyboard and a guitar, before settling on a ukulele. We were also inspired by the popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero">Guitar Hero</a> video game series.</p>
        <p>We believe that musical education is an essential part of the human experience, and we were looking at ways in which the experience of learning to play an instrument could be improved. One thing we noticed is that a difficult part of the learning process for beginners is to memorize all of the different finger positions corresponding to the various chords of their respective instruments.</p>
        <p>Our project is an attempt to make this learning process as easy as possible. We chose to build this project on the ukulele because it is a comparatively small and simple instrument, but in practice our project concept can be extended to many other instruments such as violin, guitar, piano, etc. By using lights to indicate which strings need to be held down for different chords, users can learn the ukulele much more easily, without having to constantly reference and search through chord reference sheets or trying to memorize all of them at once. </p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Math</strong></p>

        <p>The main math involved was in setting the ISR to fire at the correct intervals to transition between chords in a song based on the tempo in beats per minute provided by the user. To set OCR3A, we used the formula: <code>period = (62500 * 60) / tempo - 1</code>. 
        </p>
				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Logical Structure</strong></p>
        <p>On a high level, the user will input a command using our command line interface running on their desktop or laptop computer, which we wrote using Python. The user can specify a single chord to play, or a song file to play according to some tempo. The Python end then parses the command and song file, and sends it over serial communication to the microcontroller using a data serialization encoding what we developed.
        </p>
				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hardware Tradeoffs</strong></p>
        <p>The main hardware tradeoff was deciding whether to drive all of the lights in series or in parallel. We decided to use the series method because of the simplicity and compatibility with our drivers.</p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Software Tradeoffs</strong></p>
        <p>
          In terms of software, a big problem we ran into initially was driving the lights. The lights are driven by a very precisely timed pwm wave. We at first attempted to generate this pwm signal ourselves using the same technique as in lab 2, but we soon realized that the timing specifications were too precise and our MCU could not meet the timing specifications due to time constraints and ISRs.

				</div>
        <p><strong>Command Line Interface</strong></p>
        <p>
          To interact with the microcontroller, our project requires a desktop or laptop running Python. On this side, our user interface is a simple command line interface. There are two command formats it can take: <code>ukule_led practice "chord" port "portname"</code> and <code>ukule_led play "file" port "portname"</code>. <p>The first command type tells the microcontroller to go into practice mode, where the LEDs for a single chord are held on indefinitely (until the user specifies a different chord in practice mode or switches to play mode). The arguments for this mode are "chord", which is the chord to be played (for example "A", "C#m", "Gb7", etc), and the other argument is "portname", which is the port on the computer which is connected through USB serial cable to the microcontroller.</p><p> The second command type tells the microcontroller to go into practice mode, which plays the specified song by lighting the LEDs corresponding to the song chords sequentially according to the chord duration. The arguments are "file" which specifies the path to the song file on the local OS, and "port" which is serves the same function as previously described.
        </p>
        </p> <p>
          To implement this functionality we used the python library docopt, which allows us to easily define different command types, sanity check the user's command line input, and parse the command line arguments.
        </p> 
				<p><strong>Music File Parsing</strong></p>
				<p>
          If the user specifies play mode, the user specifies a file on the local file system which encodes a song according to a format we designed. Below is an example of a song file:</p><p>
          <code>240 4<br>
          |A B C D|E F G -|A - - B|<br>
          |A - Bbm A7|Bm X A#7 -|A - X D|</code>
				</p>
        <p>
          So the first line of the song file contains two numbers. The first number (240 in the example) represents the tempo the song should be played in, in terms of beats per minute (bpm). The range we currently support is any number between 60 and 240 bpm. The next number represents the beats per measure of the song's time signature (4 in the example). 
        </p>
        <p>
          The next lines all contain measures of the song, each measure should be delimited by a | symbol and contain a number of chords equal to the number of beats per measure specified, each chord corresponds to one measure.

				<h2>Hardware Design&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"><strong><a href="#top">top</a></strong></font></h2>

				<p>Our electronic components included an ATmega1284P microcontroller mounted on a custom PCB and 16 WS2812B RGB LEDs. These were soldered to a small solder board, along with various resistors, capacitors, jumper wires, and 6 header pins for connecting to a USB serial cable.</p>

				<p><strong>ATmega1284P Microcontroller</strong></p>

				<p>We decided to use the 1284P because we needed to use two 16-bit timers for our project. One was used by TRT, and the other was used for the timing of songs.</p>

				<p>The 1284P was also the most convenient choice. We already had a custom PCB built, which included all of the necessary power circuits. We also avoided having to learn a new microcontroller datasheet.</p>

				<p><strong>WS2812B RGB LEDs</strong></p>

				<p>We used Adafruit's NeoPixel Mini PCBs, each of which includes a WS2812B RGB LED and the necessary capacitor, as given in the WS2812B datasheet. We decided to use the PCBs instead of directly using the LEDs to make soldering easier.</p>

				<p>All of the RGB LEDs are driven from a single microcontroller I/O pin. As per the datasheet, they were all connected in series, with the Dout, 5V, and gnd pads of one wired to the Din, 5V, and gnd pads of the next. The Din pin of the first LED is connected to PORTA.0 on the microcontroller through a 330 ohm resistor to protect the first LED from any voltage spike, and the Dout pin of the last LED is not connected to anything. There is a 100 uF capacitor between the 5V and gnd lines, used to prevent large inrush currents from destroying </p>

				<p>Soldering the RGB LEDs together is the most challenging part of building the ukule-LED hardware. There should be four groups of four NeoPixel PCBs. The Din, Dout, 5V, and gnd pins of each group need to connected as described in the previous paragraph. We used very short lengths of wire, soldered to the pads on the NeoPixel PCBs, such that there was about 1-2 mm of space between each PCB. Next, these four groups need to be wired together. We used 3 approximately 4 cm lengths of wire to connect these. Finally, all 16 NeoPixel PCBs were to be hooked to the solder board with 3 approximately 50 cm lengths of wire.

				<p><strong>Serial Connection</strong></p>

				<p>We used a UART-to-USB cable to enable communication between the host PC and the microcontroller. The user specifies a song file path, then the Python CLI converts this file into a string and sends it through the cable to the microcontroller.</p>

				<p><strong>Power</strong></p>

				<p>According to the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/power">power</a> section of the Adafruit NeoPixel Überguide, each RGB LED driven at maximum brightness consumes 60 mA of current, resulting in a total current draw of 960 mA for 24 RGB LEDs.However, we drove a maximum of 4 LEDs at a time, with the macro <code>INTENS</code> to 20, out of a maximum value of 256. A back-of-the-envelope calculation gives approximately 18.75 mA of current, which is well below the absolute maximum DC current of 40 mA, given in the microcontroller's datasheet. As such, we decided that we could drive the RGB LEDs with a microcontroller pin, instead of resorting to an external power source as the Überguide suggested. We had no trouble with this.</p>

				<p>We were able to use a single 9V power supply for all of our power needs. We decided against using a 9V battery because the system has to be tethered to a computer with a USB serial cable anyways, and another cable coming out of the system is not a major inconvenience at that point.</p>

				<p><strong>Ukulele</strong></p>

				<p>To prepare the ukulele for our project, we had to dremel out the fretboard up to the fourth fret in to accomodate the RGB LEDs. We had to keep all the frets intact and keep the LEDs below the frets in order to maintain playability of the ukulele. We considered using epoxy to make the fretboard above the LEDs smooth, but we were worried that we wouldn't be able to keep the epoxy contained.</p>

				<p>We hot glued four sets of four LED to the dremeled grooves in the fretboard. We also hot glued the microcontroller and the solder board to the end of the ukulele opposite the fretboard, as shown in Figure <strong>X</strong>. Overall, we didn't add too much mass to the ukulele.</p>

				<h2>Results &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1"><strong><a href="#top">top</a></strong></font></h2>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Speed and Accuracy</strong></p>

				<p>In play mode, the system supports songs with tempos between 60 and 240 bpm. We feel that this range is enough for the vast majority of songs. These tempos are converted to timer periods by the formula <code>period = (62500 * 60) / tempo - 1</code>. This means the tempo resolution around 60 bpm is about 0.001 bpm and the tempo resolution around 240 bpm is about 0.015 bpm. This exceeds our needs considerably.</p>

				<p>However, when the user starts a new song (in play mode) or selects a new chord (in practice mode), there is a delay. This happens because we have to first send a string to the microcontroller through the USART and then preprocess the string before the LEDs corresponding to the chords in the song can be lit up. This delay is about one second long. This isn't an issue in practice mode, and thanks to the count-in we implemented, isn't a large issue in play mode.</p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Testing</strong></p>

				<p>We tested our ukulele primaily by feeding it sample song files and ensuring that the behavior was correct. We included a variety of chords: major, minor, and seventh chords, and made sure the correct LEDs were lit up and with the correct colors. We also ensured that,when no chord was specified in the current time in the song, that no LEDs are lit. We tried different time signatures to make sure the count-in mechanism worked. We also tested practice mode by feeding the system a variety of chords. Finally, we made sure that the system did not need to be power cycled during use. We tried using the device in play mode twice in a row, practice mode twice in a row, and tried to switch modes. </p>

				<p>Soldering together the RGB LEDs was difficult, and the connections were prone to breakage if the LEDs were jostled. In addition, all of the LEDs were in series, so breakage of one wire would disconnect all successive LEDs. We therefore had to test the connection every time we physically adjusted the LEDs. This was especially important before we glued the LEDs into their places within the ukulele fretboard.</p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Safety</strong></p>

				<p>There are not many electrical hazards in our system. We use a single 9V power supply, which is not enough voltage to harm someone. We also shielded the high-current RGB LED data line with a layer of hot glue. As the user's fingers come very close to the LEDs while the system is in use, we used hot glue to shield all of those wires as well. The hot glue also gave our connections some mechanical strength. </p>

				<p>One possible hazard is the fact that there are two cables coming out of ukulele, the power supply cable and the USB serial cable. These may pose a tripping hazard, but we do not think it is a major concern, since the wires can all be disconnected when the system is not in use.</p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Usability</strong></p>

				<p>One of our goals in designing ukule-LED was to detract from the ukulele experience as little as possible. This is what makes it usuable as a ukulele tutor. We did this by first minimizing the mass of the components we used. Next, we tried to arrange the wiring so that it is unobstrusive when the user is holding the ukulele in a playing position.</p>

				<p>We feel that our system is intuitive to use, but we found that ukulele beginners needed to start with practice mode in order figure out finger positions for chords before they could proceed to play mode</p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Extensibility</strong></p>

				<p>ukule-LED can easily be extended. Currently, the system <strong>only</strong> supports major, minor, and 7th chords, where major chords are lit up in green, minor chords in red, and 7th chords in blue. The files <code>chord_map.py</code> and <code>chord_lookup_table.h</code> determine what chords are supported and what colors individual chords light up in. More specifically, <code>chord_map.py</code> maps chord names to their indices, and <code>chord_lookup_table.h</code> maps indices to LED patterns and colors. By editing these two files, a user can extend the system's functionality. In one possible extension, by adding to both files, a user add support for all types of chords. C#7sus4, anyone? In another possible extension, the user can use LED color to tell the user specifically where to place each finger while playing a chord. For example, a red LED would correspond to the index finger position. There are many directions this project can be taken.</p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Intellectual Property Considerations</strong></p>

				<p dir="ltr"><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong></p>

        <p>In designing and building ukule-LED, we adhered to the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html">IEEE Code of Ethics</a>.</p>

        <p>We made decisions to ensure the safety of ourselves and of users. We shielded all high-current wires with hot glue, checked diligently for short circuits and other electrical hazards, and made all cables detachable to minimize tripping hazards. When working with potentially dangerous lab equipment such as the soldering iron, the hot glue gun, and the Dremel, we made sure to use the tools following the proper procedures and safety precautions. In terms of safety, we always wore goggles when soldering, and wearing both goggles and respiratory mask when using the Dremel.</p>

        <p>We were careful to avoid damage to lab equipment and to others' projects. We also complied with the rules and regulations of the lab. We kept our lab station clean after use with the next group in mind.</p>

        <p>We honestly accepted criticism for our work, in the form of our proposal review and debugging help from the course TAs and instructor. We also thoroughly acknowledged our sources and inspirations, including the libraries and drivers that made our work much simpler. We also assisted our fellow students in the course by providing honest criticism if asked, but we stayed well within the limits outlined in the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity.</p>
